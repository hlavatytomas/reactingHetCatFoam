Folder with 2D simulations with reacting rectangle porous zone in the domain.

Includes:
    reactingRect2D_Simple       
        -- case working with our previous implementation of the reactingHetCatSimpleFoam (steady-state)
        -- only one temperature field in the domain (averaged properties of the solid and gas phases)
    
    reactingRect2D_SimplePMT    
        -- case working with new implementation of the reactingHetCatSimpleFoamPMT (steady-state)
        -- separate temperature of the porous media and the gas
        -- coupling between temperatures of phases ensured by heat transfer source = kH*a*(Ts-Tg)
        -- kH ... heat transfer coefficient [W m-2 K-1] 
        -- a  ... specific area [m2 m-3]
        
        NOTES:
            -- heat source on the phase interface needs to be implemented
    
    reactingRect2D_Pimple
        -- dynamic version of the reactingRect2D_SimplePMT
